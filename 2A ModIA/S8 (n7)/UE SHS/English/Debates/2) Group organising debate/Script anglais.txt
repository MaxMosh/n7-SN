Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Chamber for a debate on a topical issue, a veritable political hot potato whose motion is as follows: ‘This house believes that social media have a bad impact on society’.
-- applause

On my right, the party that agrees with this thesis and will proudly support it with the idea of protecting our great society!
-- noise from the audience

On my left, the party that will try to undermine this thesis and pass it off as one of the most frivolous conspiracy theories!
-- noise from the audience

Shut up! Please be quiet! You each want to defend your opinions, which I can understand, but please try to ensure that next week's thesis is not: ‘This house thinks that debates are too dangerous to be allowed to continue’. Anyway... The rules of the debate are very simple: you will each have 5 minutes of debate. The first minute is yours: absolutely no one can stand in your way. Then, the following 3 minutes will be hell for each of you: the opposing party may interrupt you at any time to impose a ‘point of information’ which will question in real time the arguments you have put forward. Needless to say, this will also question your honesty in terms of the plausibility of the points of view you present, depending on how you respond. Finally, the floor is fully yours in the last minute.

To impose your ‘point of information’, you will need to act as follows: *stands up, taps his head and raises his arms in the air*. I'll then ask the speaker if he wants to listen or not, and you'll then be free to accept or refuse the POI.

I almost forgot! I'm joined today by my fabulous team, on my right...

And let's not forget our second superhero, on my left...

Thank you, I love you both from the bottom of my heart, we should go bowling someday... Now that the introductions have been made, let's hear from those who think that social media have a bad impact on society. Felindra, tête de tigre! Hum sorry... Duy, start the countdown!
